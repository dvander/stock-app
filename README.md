This is a simple, minimalist Android app to watch your favorite stocks. It requires Android P or
higher.

To use this app, you must configure it with an API key from one of the supported API services. We
recommend IEX Cloud, which has very generous free services. The full list of supported APIs:
 - [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/) - 500,000 free queries per month.
 - [World Trading Data](https://www.worldtradingdata.com/) - 250 free queries per day.
 - [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) - 5 free queries per minute.
 - [Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) - Requires paid subscription.
